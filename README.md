# Customer_Segmentation_and_Recommendation-Kindle

Description:
In this project I aimed to gain insight from customer ratings and reviews from the Amazon Kindle store. The dataset used was provided by UCSD (please see source below). The project had two components, firstly I used NLP techniques to perform topic modeling to find different user groups. Secondly, I used the user ratings to build a item-item colloborative filtering recommendation system.
